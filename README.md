# todolist (using APIs)

For this API Project in MIS 2402, we used the '$.getJSON()' and '$.post()' jQuery methods to implement a simple to-do list application. 

This “todo” API is written in such a way that it will hold data for 24 hours. Data added to the “to do” list will automatically wash out of the server’s memory after one day.

** I have linked a video demo since the actual link will not work for public users.
